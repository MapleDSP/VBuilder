VBuilder is part of a methodology for reusing IP modules written in the Verilog language on a building block basis. Modules are encapsulated with a top level template, 
which implements a common top level connection methodology. The format and content of this is up to the individual designer.

Each IP module is represented by a schematic symbol, which can be instantiated using a schematic editor, and then wired to other modules at will, 
representing a pictorial display of a system. A top level component implements the connections to the pins of the FPGA, or to another container module. 

This enables a system design methodology that implements a framework that is developed once to interact with devices that are connected to the FPGA, 
therefore simplifying future design efforts. Processing modules can be then instantiated as needed to fit different system requirements.

VBuilder is a utility program to enable this design philosophy for modules described in a netlist, which can be generated by a schematic capture program. 
The netlist is generated in XML format, which is read by VBuilder and converted into Verilog code. 

The current version is 0.2.
